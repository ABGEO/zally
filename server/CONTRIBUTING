## Formatting

### editorconfig

This project includes a [`.editorconfig`](.editorconfig) file. Make sure your editor
is considering it for automatic formatting of the source code. If your editor does
not support `.editorconfig` files, open the file and apply those settings manually.

### ktlint

The [`ktlint`](https://github.com/shyiko/ktlint) Gradle plugin is also configured. Make
sure to apply its formatting before committing code.

    ./gradlew ktlintFormat

`ktlint` considers the `.editorconfig` file when linting and formatting.

To help development tasks, the `ktlint` style can be automatically applied to the
local _IntelliJ IDEA_ project.

    ./gradlew ktlineIntegrateIJ

_IntelliJ IDEA_ will then format the code as you edit it using the `ktlint` rules.
